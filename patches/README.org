Since I use =nixpkgs-unstable= (I am an Arch user by heart), there are some cases where certain packages will break or fail to build (usually due to my extremely customized, non-standard system).

With Nix, I /could/ just rollback everything and wait to update until an upstream patch fixes things, but if it's a quick fix, I'd rather just patch it in immediately so that everything else can stay up to date.

** List of Patches
Here is a list of patches in this directory, along with a more detailed description of why it's necessary:

| Patch                        | Reason                                                                                       |

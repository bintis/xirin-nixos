#+title: System-level Nix Modules
#+author: Emmet

Separate Nix files can be imported as modules using an import block:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
imports = [ import1.nix
            import2.nix
            ...
          ];
#+END_SRC

My system-level Nix modules are organized into this directory:
- [[./hardware-configuration.nix][hardware-configuration]] - Default hardware config generated for my system
- [[./app][app]] - Necessary system-level configuration to get various apps working
- [[./hardware][hardware]] - Hardware configurations I may need to use
- [[./security][security]] - System-level security stuff
- [[./style][style]] - Stylix setup (system-wide base16 theme generation)
- [[./wm][wm]] - Necessary system-level configuration to get various window managers, wayland compositors, and/or desktop environments working

** Variables imported from flake.nix
Variables can be imported from [[../flake.nix][flake.nix]] by setting the =specialArgs= block inside the flake (see [[../flake.nix][my flake]] for more details).  This allows variables to merely be managed in one place ([[../flake.nix][flake.nix]]) rather than having to manage them in multiple locations.

I currently import the following variables to the system config:
- =username= - Username
- =hostname= - Hostname for machine
- =timezone= - Timezone for machine
- =locale= - Locale for machine
- =theme= - base16 theme stored in ../themes to be used
- =backgroundUrl= - Direct link to background wallpaper (used for login screen)
- =backgroundSha256= - Checksum for background image used when downloading
